This script uses Python 3 and dnspython3

This is a fork of the folowing github repository https://github.com/scottbrady91/Python-Email-Verification-Script the version that I have does not reflect the changes on the original repository. Instead I have chosen to use the older code but modify the code ot suit my needs. It's not meant for bulk email validation. See the notes I have placed in the source code.
